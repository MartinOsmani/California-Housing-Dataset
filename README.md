# California-Housing-Dataset machine learning model and guide

# Description
After learning the basics of machine learning, I thought to create a step by step guide on
building my first ml model based on the California-Housing-Dataset. This guide covers different 
approaches in a step-by-step basis. 

# Credits
This guide is heavily based on the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and 
TenerFlow, 3rd edition" by Aurélien Géron. I've tried taking the main concepts from the book and
paraphrasing them but if you are new to machine learning I recommend reading it from the beginning
as it is very well put together.

I will keep this readme updated as I work through the guide.
